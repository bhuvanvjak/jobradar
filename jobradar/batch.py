"""Shared batch-scoring prompt and parser.

Three things drive the token bill, and this module addresses all three:

* **Per-call overhead.** Providers prepend their own preamble (xkiro adds ~550
  tokens), so one request per job would pay that thousands of times. Batching
  amortises it.
* **Output tokens.** They are billed like input and there is no cache discount.
  Repeating `"skills":`, `"seniority":` and friends for every job is pure
  waste, so replies are compact positional arrays, not objects.
* **The repeated prefix.** The instructions and the candidate profile are
  identical across every batch of a run. They go in a separate system message
  so providers that cache prompt prefixes can charge a tenth for them.

score 0-10. The six middle numbers are 0-100. reason is at most 8 words.

score 10 = perfect fit, 0 = wrong field.
Seniority is a hard gate, not a tiebreaker: a title containing Senior, Sr,
Staff, Principal, Lead, Manager, Head, Director or VP, or a stated requirement
of more years than the candidate has, scores at most 3 however well the skills
match. Set location at most 30 when the role is onsite somewhere they cannot
